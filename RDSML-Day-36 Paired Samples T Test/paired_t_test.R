# A paired samples t-test was used to determine whether there was a
# Statistically significant mean difference between the distance ran
# when participants imbibed a carbohydrate-protein drink compared to
# carbohydrate-only drink.  No outleirs were detected. The assumption 
# of normality was not violated, as assessed by shipro-wilk's test
# (p = 0.78). Participants ran further when imbibing the carbohydrate-
# protein drink ( Mean = 11.302 KM, SD = 0.713 KM) as opposed to the
# carbohydrate only drink (Mean = 11.167 KM, SD = 0.726 KM)
# a statistically significant mean increase of 0. 135 KM, 
# 95% CI [0.091, 0.181], t(19) = 6.352, p <= .001, Cohen's d estimate: 0.187.
